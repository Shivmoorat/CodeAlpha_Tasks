        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm from Azamgarh, Uttar Pradesh. I completed my high school in 2012 with 83.5%, intermediate in 2014 with 86% in the Science stream, and my graduation in B.A. in 2017 with 53%. Alongside my degree, I completed IT O level from NIELIT in 2018 and earned a certificate. I also did the CFA course for accounting in Tally ERP9.</p>
        <p>I worked as a Data Entry Operator at Ispat Carriers Pvt Ltd from January 2018 to May 2022. Currently, I am pursuing IT A level from NIELIT at Jadavpur University, Kolkata.</p>


        <p>My journey from data entry and logistics to advanced IT certification highlights my commitment to continuous learning and skill development. My background in data management, coupled with my current IT studies, positions me well for roles that demand a combination of technical and administrative expertise. As I progress through my IT A level certification, I am equipping myself with more specialized skills, positioning me to transition into roles within IT and software, and potentially explore new career paths in software development, systems analysis, or data management.

            With my dedication to education and hands-on experience, I exemplify the traits of a lifelong learner, ready to take on new challenges and expand my professional horizons. My journey reflects a balance of practical experience and technical learning, making me well-prepared for future opportunities in the evolving fields of information technology and data management.</p>
